User, I noticed you asked a question about forms. In our web development course, we covered forms in detail.

The concept of forms was introduced in Video 9 (Forms and input tags in HTML). We discussed what forms are and their purpose in web pages, including contact pages, Google forms, and inquiry forms.

Specifically, the section on "what are forms" starts at timestamp 11.3 seconds into Video 9 and lasts until approximately 16.2 seconds.

If you'd like to learn more about forms and input tags, I recommend watching Video 9 (Forms and input tags in HTML) from the start until it ends. This will give you a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

Let me know if you have any further questions or need clarification on anything!
