    "text": " Guys, in video number 12, I gave you an exercise and I told you all to post your solution. In today's video, I will solve that exercise and tell you. And I am going to give a shoutout to all those people who have solved that exercise. Let's go to the computer screen. I am really very excited to see your solutions. Let's roll the intro. \ud83c\udfb6 Music \ud83c\udfb6 So guys, I have come to my computer screen. And the first thing I will do is make a folder named video 16. So I will write here video 16. And after opening it, right click on it, open with code. And after doing this, I will make a boilerplate template here. Today we are going to do a little special work. Because today everyone will get a shoutout. So first of all, if you have not accessed the playlist, then do access it. Now I am going to open this video here. So I opened this video in which I had given you exercise. And this exercise was about a pure HTML media player. So I told you to make a media player in this. And here I am doing sort by new as first. And I will come down completely. And after coming down completely, what I will do here is I will give a shoutout to all those people who have solved this. So guys, I have scrolled all the way down. It took me a long time to scroll, to be honest. I will give a shoutout to everyone. But before that, I want to solve this question for you. So here you can see 1.mp3, 1.mp4, 2.mp3, all the way till 5.mp3. So what I will do first is I will put an h1. My videos for the day. Okay, I will write h1 here. And here I will write some audios for the day. Okay, I do videos and audios for the day. What I will do here is I will toggle the screencast mode. Because it looks a little easy to you. And here some videos. So I wrote an h1 and here I put an h2. And here I will simply put videos in a div. So as soon as I write a video tag here, And after that I will write controls here. So I will actually be able to watch this 1.mp4. What I will do simply is I will press shift, alt and down arrow. And here I will write 2, then I will write 3 here. Then I will write 4 here. And then I will write 5 here. And I will do the same thing for audio as well. And here I will write audio. And here I will write 1.mp3. And after that I will write controls. Okay, and after that I will do the same thing. And I will replicate it 5 times. I did 2, 3, 4. And here I will do 5. And obviously I will try to show you by previewing it here. Now there is a problem here. The problem is that it is taking the full width. And it is becoming very problematic for me I guess. Maybe because I am zoomed in. Okay, so it is not becoming problematic actually. Otherwise we would have reset it from CSS. But for now I think we are good. We will see how to resize it in CSS. How things can be improved. But I think our videos have come here. And some audios for the day have also come. So you can see the audios. And if you will put songs then songs will come. I have not put songs. You can see my videos are playing here. And these are the videos. And this is my personal favorite. So you must have put your favorite videos. But that was pretty much about it. And many people are saying that this is very easy. This exercise was so simple. We will raise the bar like anything. Remember my words. Now we will give shoutout. Shoutout to Soumya172. Shoutout to Code with Rohit who accepted the challenge. Here multiatmos, desireddy, shantop, Harsh Gularia. Then Hellstar Kun, Team Rewa, Kulsum Saqibward. Shoutout to 0b01th, Mohan, 2492, Prakash, Arnab. Then Jilan, HR, Nikhil, Ashutosh. And now I will give shoutout to those who have solved. I will give shoutout to those who have solved. Has anyone solved? I will see the replies. Has anyone solved? I will see the replies. Has anyone solved? No. No. Ok. So Coder Anderson. Congratulations to you. You have won 7 crore rupees. You have used the table for the first time. Which is fine. Ideally, tables are not used. So this kind of work is done. But I think we are good. From 1 to 6, they have shown the videos. They have given width and height in the video. Which is a great thing. I will also do it in my video. I will also do it in my video. In fact, what I will do is I will write width is equal to 239. I will write width is equal to 239. Let's see how it changes. It is looking better. Why didn't I think of this idea? When I was solving. Shoutout to Cody Anderson. Shoutout to you. Now who has solved the next one? Now who has solved the next one? Shoutout to Saif0981. You have solved it beautifully. You have solved it beautifully. Very good. Shoutout to Cesar Murti. Shoutout to Cesar Murti. Shoutout to Jheel Maheshwari. I want to say one thing. Many of you have not solved it. This was not the participation I was looking for. I wanted more participation. I wanted more participation. I wanted everyone to solve it. Very few people have solved it. I want more people to solve it. I want more people to solve it. I saw very few people have solved it. I saw very few people have solved it. I don't see any other code. I don't see any other code. So in the coming videos, I want everyone to solve the challenges. And whoever solves first, I will give him a shoutout in the comments. So you guys have to respond a little fast. So you guys have to respond a little fast. And shoutout to everyone who is writing challenge accepted. I hope you are enjoying this course. I hope you are enjoying this course. Access all the source code and playlists.
