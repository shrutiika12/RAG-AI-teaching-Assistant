    "text": " In this video, we will know what are forms and what is the input tag in the form. Using a form is a very important element of some websites because through the form, you submit data from client to server. These are the forms that you see on contact pages, Google forms or inquiry forms. The date and time to go to the flight or railway ticket, we put all these details, they also submit through the HTML forms. In the last video, very few people liked it, I will request you to like this video with high energy so that we can maintain high energy throughout the course. So let's go to the computer screen, we will see about the forms, we will see about the input tags and we will see some best practices. Let's roll the intro. So guys I have come to my computer screen and now see I am going to make a folder here which I am going to name video6 because this is the sixth video. I will click on shift right, I will open with code, I have already told you all this. And here I am going to make index.html and what I will do by putting an exclamation mark in it, I will wrap the view word, I will turn on the screen cast mode and you will see here I will write forms, let's learn it. So I have set the title of this forms page here and what happened by setting the title that the title will be visible on our page. Here I want to tell you a very important setting, show preview, many of you have pointed out to me in the comment that you have to click so many times, can you do something? Yes you can, here you click on the gear, click on settings and after clicking on settings, what you do simply, write live preview here, live preview and we can actually set it such that whenever we click, it will open on the external browser. So now I will close everything, as soon as I click here, it will open on the external browser and I come to my browser and the playlist of the Sigma web development course is accessing it by clicking on the star and here on the bookmark. But now I want to tell you that as soon as we click here, you see it opened, so if you want this, then do this, but sometimes what happens is that you want to prefer side by side view and when do you want to do that? So whenever you are working on design by using HTML, CSS, so whenever you are working on design, you definitely want to see live previews here, which is why this extension was made and it was made different from the live server so that you can see the preview on the side. Now what we will do here, we will know about the form, what is the form, you know the name, the form means that we fill the form of the railway, with that we have a reservation, with that we fill the form of IIT JEE, we fill the form of NEET, we fill the form of any exam so that our data can reach those who want it, so this is the form, HTML form tag is now as soon as you write the form, you will enter, in this way the first question will ask you what is the action of your form, get or post, get request and post request, I will tell you a very quick difference, that we will see this thing later when we will read the backend, get request is a very simple request and post request is when we send in most of the cases when we have to give a lot of data, like whenever our form will be posted, then in most of the cases we will use post request and get request is a very simple request that we just have to tell the server something and that's it or we have to hit the server with a request, that's it, but if you don't understand this thing now, that should be fine, there is no problem, because we are going to do this in detail later, so form action is equal to post, I have written here, now I can show some input tags in it, I will tell you what are input tags, that what elements will come in your form, like you can put a date, you can put in the form, you can tell the name, you can tell the phone number, you can say what is your age, it can be just a number, you want to put such things in the form, so I want to tell you that the input tag that you put in the form and there is a label tag that is used to label that input, so what I will do here, you see the simplest input tag is type is equal to text, so I will put the input type is equal to text here and you see here, if I zoom out and show you, so see input type is equal to text, name is equal to username, placeholder, enter your username and it will actually look something like this, so you can say here enter your username and the user in front of you will have to enter the username, I write an H1 here and I write here, assume form to apply for TA for sigma web dev TA, sigma web development course TA, assume we are hiring teaching assistants for sigma web development course, so we can write something like this here, by the way I have put the subtitles, if you have not accessed the playlist, then do access it and with that I show you one more thing, so the subtitles are very funny, I will show you, write sigma batch op and your village land and give your village land to me, means someone is watching English, someone is watching who does not know Hindi at all, he will say that what happened till here and give your village land to me, I like this a lot, now you can see here that I have put the H1 here, which is our heading, this is our main heading, enter your username, this is our input tag, along with the input tag, we use the label tag, now whose label is this, so for is equal to I will write its ID, I will write its ID username and what I will do in for is equal to, I will put its ID in for is equal to, now what is this ID, I will tell you later, for now you just understand that it is a unique identifier of an element, to identify this element uniquely, like your Aadhar number cannot be of anyone else, in the same way, this ID username has been given to it, now it cannot be given to anyone else, this is the ID, I will tell you more in detail, but now understand this much, so I wrote label for is equal to username, I wrote this input and you can see here that the label will come here, so I am seeing here, I have not put anything in the label, so I will put enter your username and you can see that as soon as I put this here, you will get to see here, enter your username, after this you can enter your username, along with that you can enter your expertise here, you can put anything, suppose I have to ask here what is your gender, so I can do something like this here, and you see enter your gender and as soon as I did this, I can ask you what is male or female, now what happens here is that sometimes we wrap it in div, what is div, div is our block element, and what are inline and block elements, I have not told you in this course yet, but I will tell you in the coming videos, so for now you just understand that I am putting it in div to give a new space, so as soon as I put it in div, it will come in a new space, yes, there is also a br tag, which comes with line break, but I don't prefer br tag, and you will get to know why, why we don't want to bloat our html with br tag, you will get to know this in the coming videos, now you see here that enter your username, here male or female, now you see here that as soon as I click on female, this radio button is selected, I am clicking on male, this is selected, why is this happening, because the label of this, I have put for is equal to female and here I have put id female, and along with that, I have put the name of both of them, here name is equal to gender, I have put this input tag and name is equal to gender, I have put this input radio tag, and as soon as we have written type is equal to radio, it means this is a radio button, and if we have made its name the same, then only one of these two can be selected at a time, that is, if I select this, then only this will happen, if I select this, then only this will happen, now I will show you one thing, if I make a mistake in the id of the label form, and here also in the form, I don't make a mistake in the first one, I make a mistake in the second one, so when I click on the female of the second one, it will not be selected, I am clicking, it is not being selected, I am clicking on the male, it is being selected, so to select the female, I have to click on it, so what I should do is always put the id of the input tag, so you can see here I have put the label for is equal to female, along with that we have an input tag which is type is equal to checkbox, now see here if I put the input of type is equal to checkbox, I will do this work by putting it in div, and as soon as I do the format document, our document will be very good, that is, its formatting and indentation will be very good, now see here, here I can check subscribe to newsletter, and the difference between radio button and checkbox is that you can check the checkbox, if you want to give one of the male or female options, then you can select it like this, after this we have text area and select tag, and I will show you what it is, so text area and select tag works like this, as soon as you copy the text area here, and I will show you by putting it here, so text area input type is equal to text, but it has rows and column attributes, which helps you to make its size small, now see here, the placeholder inside it, I have given enter your comment here, so I have given the text inside it, ideally what we will do is we will keep it empty, or we will not give a new line in it, so I will keep it here, enter your comment here, and now it will reach the left side, I will show you, so it has reached the left side, enter your comment here, and any user can put his comment here, now see I have put the content of text area, enter your comment here, so ideally you will not want to do this, you will want to keep the text area empty, and you will want to put a label, and you can say label for is equal to comment, and definitely we will put id here, whenever we put for, then it is inside for, and for element it is its id, now see here, if I write enter your comment here, so what will happen, if I write enter your comment, then it will come here, now you will say that this is not styled properly, so this is not styled properly because we will style it with CSS later, for now I will put just br tag, but I don't recommend br tag, I am telling you again, I do not recommend br tag at all, because br tag has problems, you should know br tag, it is a line break tag, now you must be thinking that everything is fine, but I will tell you br tag is something that I don't recommend, it is not that you don't have to use it, but I don't recommend using it all the time, means the easiest thing is that people think that you can put br tag and add new spaces, I oppose this a lot, so I will copy this and show select tag to you, and you see here, as soon as I put select tag here, I put it inside div, so in select you get some options, so you see here, select syntax is like this, you can use any of the three, now you see here, any of the three can be used, and here I have done value is equal to apple, first I made select tag, then option value is equal to apple, option value is equal to banana, option value is equal to cherry, when we will parse this form data, then I will tell you in javascript part, how to take this data and send it to the server, so there are a lot of things about the form that are remaining, I am going to tell you, so stay tuned for that, this was about forms, I had to tell you all the elements of the form in this video, and along with that I have told you about select tag and all these things, so about the form, the rest of the attributes, like action, I told you, you can submit form on any page from action, and where will it handle the form, so you can give that data here, then there is a method, get request or post request, I will tell you the difference in these two in the coming videos, but I have told you in a very rough way, that get request is a very simple request, post request is used when you have to send big data to the server, because there is a limit of get request, in post request you can send a lot of data, in get request we don't even send passwords, we send it with the help of post request, now here I have told you the method, what happens in name, name is equal to username, means we mark it with name, so the server will know which key value is corresponding to it, so the key value that will go to the server will go according to the name, so when we will do server side processing, what is placeholder, placeholder means what will be written inside it, like here enter your username, placeholder, if I click on it, then enter your username is not written inside it, I will write anything, see it came, but enter your username is telling me that I have to put username inside it, then required means you have to require it, you have to put the value of it, otherwise your form will not be submitted, so we will use this a lot, then after this we get autofocus, what does autofocus do, autofocus automatically focuses the cursor, so I will show you the magic of autofocus, so if you have written autofocus inside the input tag, so I have written autofocus in enter your username, now I will reload it, so if I type on it, then automatically focus will be on it, so by autofocus, whatever you type will be typed here, I hope you are understanding things, now validation attribute, here required I have told you, you can give a pattern, in which you can give regular expression pattern, now don't get confused, don't say that what are you talking about, we don't know regular expression, I am sitting here to teach you all things, but you understand that we will accept only one particular pattern, if we have put pattern is equal to this, then you can't put anything other than this pattern, so you should know this thing here, so I hope you are enjoying this video, and with that, write sigma batch op in the comment section, and go to the first video and please review this course, because still many people ask me that should I do this course or not, because this course is free, so people don't value it, they say that this course is free, so we should watch it or take a paid course, and I would like to give a note for those people who told me that we have taken a paid course, now what should we do, they should collect money or we should join sigma batch, you should join sigma batch, cut your losses and join sigma batch, because what is the quality of this course, I don't think you need to tell me, so you should come and do this, you will get everything here, I am telling you, this course is free, so I was going to sell you for 10,000 rupees, and I think there is nothing wrong in selling any course, but the thing is if you have bought any other course and you still feel that sigma is a very good course, then you should join, cut your losses and join, because once you make your career, then you will not need any of these things in the future, if you look back in the future, then you will also say that we took a paid course, then we took a free course, and if you become a career, then all these things will not matter in the future, so do what is right for you, and you work while understanding your cycle, I hope you are understanding things, so like the video, access the playlist, subscribe to the channel, and write sigma batch op in the comment section below, and name your village and town, that's all for now, thank you so much for watching this video, and I will see you next time."
