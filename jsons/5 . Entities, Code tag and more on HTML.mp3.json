    "text": " Guys, we have seen almost everything in HTML. In today's video, we will conclude HTML and talk about some such miscellaneous things which will help you a lot in your web development journey. After that, we will start CSS from the coming videos. I am very excited to conclude HTML. You guys like this video and write Sigma patch op in the comment section below. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So guys, as you can see, I have come to my computer screen. And without wasting time, I will create a new folder here. I will name it video 13. I will come in this, right click and open the VS code. And I will make a file index.html. Okay. Now here I have given the file index.html. Now I want to tell you one thing. There are many things in HTML that you have to explore yourself. I will tell you some things here and after this video, I will conclude HTML. If you want in HTML, I will turn on Word Wrap and toggle Screencast Mode. Suppose you want to write this in HTML, 3 is greater than 4. Suppose you want to write this. If you try to write this in HTML, I will show you the preview of this. So it came here by writing 3 is greater than 4. Now suppose I write here, this is the code for paragraph. Okay. And I write something like this. Now I have written this here. I want it to appear. But you see here, it will not appear. Why not? Because how will it know that I want to write the code for paragraph or I want to use this P tag as a syntax. So HTML entities are to be avoided from this. Now let me tell you what HTML entities are. If you write ampersand lt semicolon here, lt for less than, then you can write it as lt semicolon. Now if you write ampersand lt semicolon here, and replace it with ampersand lt semicolon, and you replace the greater than with ampersand gt semicolon. I will show you this thing. If you replace it with ampersand gt semicolon, then what will happen? That it will appear here as it is written. As you can see, I will zoom in and show you. Okay. So what happens is that HTML entities are used to write those things that may collide with the syntax of HTML. What does it mean to collide? If we write the code of paragraph tag here, then how will HTML know that this is the code of paragraph tag? Or if you want to write this thing as it is. There is also a pre tag for this. If you put anything in the pre tag, and you write here, then P, this is a para. So if you write it like this, then it will come here as it is. As you can see. Okay. It will come as it is. And along with that, if you write new lines here, this is after few new lines. Okay. And some more. If you write like this, then it will come as it is. Keeping all the spaces intact. Keeping all the new lines intact. But it is not that tags will show up here. For tags, we will have to use entities. So this happens in pre tag HTML. So we have seen entities, we have seen pre tag. If you want to put a copyright symbol, then you can write ampersand copy semicolon. And as you write ampersand copy semicolon here, then you will get to see the copyright symbol here. As you can see. Okay. So you can do such things with the help of HTML entities. So you try out all these examples. Non-breaking spaces. Along with that, you can use special symbols. Like we saw copyright. Ampersand nbsp is used for space. And it is very important. So if I write here copyright. Okay. I write here copyright. And suppose I want for some reason, after seeing a lot of spaces here. And I write here code with Harry. Okay. So if I write copyright code with Harry, then this space will be considered as a fake space. Because the extra spaces in HTML are ignored. So if you see here, then the code with Harry came immediately after the copyright. But ideally we don't want that. What do we want? We want that the spaces that I have put, they come. So don't put spaces. You put ampersand nbsp. The more you put ampersand nbsp, the more spaces will come. You see here. These spaces are coming. So whenever you want to put space in your HTML code, ampersand nbsp is something you should go after. Okay. So here, how to put these breaking spaces, and along with that, the reserved characters in HTML, like less than, greater than, you can do all this with HTML entities. After this, what is quotation tag? Quotation tag helps you write quotation in this way. I will tell you the example of quotation tag here. So the quotation tag works like this. And as soon as you write, this quotation text here. So what will happen is that the search engines will know that you are actually writing a quotation. Okay. And you can also style it with CSS. Then here, if you want to cite anything, you can put its URL. Similarly, you can also use Q tag. Site is equal to, put the URL here. Okay. So if you want to cite any research article, or there can be other reasons. If you want to cite Wikipedia, then this tag is used. Okay. And you can style it, obviously with the help of CSS. So these are our quotation tags. Okay. And HTML entities. Then there are some HTML tags which have become obsolete. Like font tag has become obsolete because now with the help of CSS, we handle font. We don't use font tag. Font had a lot of attributes, like color, size, and in this way, you can use font tag. But it's not recommended that you use font tag. Then center tag, it was helpful in centering things. But now I will recommend you that we will center with CSS. Flexbox Grid etc. The modern CSS, we will learn. So all these tags are those about which you should know. But you should also know that you don't have to use them. Okay. I hope that helps. Then code tag. Tag is the most important for coders. Like you are seeing this website here, codewithari.com. Here you are seeing that I have used the code tag here. And if you are very excited about this thing, then I will tell you that I am using a library called Prism CSS. Many people ask me. And how to do all these things, I will tell you. Prism JS. Prism JS. Yes, Prism.js. What happens with this is that your code is highlighted. In this way, you can put code in your blog etc. So I am using this library. I will tell you how to do everything. I am also using React in this. We are going to read all those things later. So don't worry at all. But if you want to write code in this way, then you have to use the code tag. If you go to its source code by right clicking, then you will see that any code is written is written in the pre and in the code tag. See, I have put pre and then I have put code tag. If you look below, then any kind of code if you get on my site, then it will be in the code tag. Okay. So here you can copy this code and then you can paste it and run it. So you can also write your multi-line code here. In pre. Why is pre put? So that the new lines are intact. For example, I want to write a code here. And here, I want to write a Python code. Okay. Or I want to write HTML code. I will press ctrl n and I will make it HTML here. And I will enter by marking the exclamation mark. And I will copy and paste here. And I will write here in H1 that this is I will write in H1 this is HTML boilerplate code. Okay. So if I preview this, then here this is HTML boilerplate code which is actually rendered. If I want to write the code as it is, then what I have to do is that I have to replace this less than sign. I will right click and change all occurrences. And what I will do here ampersand lt semicolon. I told you lt semicolon. And along with that, this greater than symbol I will right click and change all occurrences. ampersand ampersand gt semicolon. Now I will paste this code there. I can't paste as it is. Okay. So this thing is also very important. Now see it will come here. So see here this code has come as it is. So anyone who wants to copy etc. can do it. You have to note one thing that these spaces are also coming because of pre tag. If you don't want these spaces to come, then select them. Press shift and tab. So what happens with shift tab? One indent is reduced. Okay. So you can do this and then press backspace here. And I will remove extra space from here too.
